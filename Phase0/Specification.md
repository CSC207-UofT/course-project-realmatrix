# Specification

A program that helps users memorize contents via cards.

Users can log in to our program, and access or create pack(s) for topics they want to memorize (e.g. Derivative Formula pack, FSL100 pack). In each pack, users can add/edit/remove/search/order cards, and view the whole list of cards they created. Each card contains a term on one side, the term's definition on the other side, and a proficiency index that represents how well the user masters the card.

To memorize cards in a pack, users can choose to **learn** or **review** cards.

The card's proficiency index will be updated according to user's learning/reviewing performance, and affects the frequency that the cards appear in future learning/reviewing modes.
