## 1. Principle of Universal Design

### (1) Principle 1: Equitable Use
We currently don't have this feature. In the future, we can add speaking mode to help people with visual problems. For example, when learning, an AI will speak term and definition out loud.

### (2) Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Users can use our project not only to memorize words with simple term and definition, they can also use it to memorize complex knowledge, given that they can enter multi-line term & definition and the learning/reviewing mode have scrollable feature.

In the future, we can add functions that allow user to add cards in a bulk, for example by importing a csv file, instead of adding a card one-by-one by typing. 

### (3) Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
We have provided "effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion." For example, when a user added a card/pack with same name, there will be a warning window pop up that tells the user to change the input. And all those warning windows are **easy to understand and provide details that instruct what the users should do**.

### (4) Principle 4: Perceptible Information
We have maximized "legibility" of essential information. In the learning mode, the term and definition being learned have a relatively large font. Also, the review/learn button (which represents our project's main function) have a different color with other buttons, so that users can easily choose them.

### (5) Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
We "provide warnings of hazards and errors." For example, when user entered empty username, a warning window will pop up. Also, we arranged most used elements in more accessible areas. For example, in the user's home page, the checkout packages button is at the top, while other buttons for changing user information are below.

### (6) Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
We have minimized unnecessary buttons. Initially, when user clicks learn/review button and goes into learning/reviewing frame, they have to click again to actually start learning/reviewing. Now, we cut off the redundant start button.

### (7) Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The scrollable feature when learning/reviewing and viewing packs/cards enables user to see the whole content easily.

We currently implement most GUI's frame without layout manager, i.e. simply setting positions for each component. In the future, we could revise GUI's layout so that the size can be zoomed in and out while the component's size can be changed.

## 2. Targeting Customers
We would market our project mostly to students, but more generally, we would target any person who need to memorize stuff. We mainly target students because this group of people has to memorize knowledge quite often. But people who are new to some industry may also need to memorize terminology or new stuff, so they are also our target customers.

## 3. Less likely customers
Currently, our program is less likely to market to people who can't type, because we require users to type in the card's term and definition.
